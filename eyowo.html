                        <p>
                            Most everyday team communications took place in a Slack channel which we used for general communications such as keeping track of progress and posting and getting quick answers and questions regarding the design and UX, as well as the progress of the project.
                        </p><p>
                            Whenever needed, design assets would also be shared in the channel. For example, while working on implementing the design and assets, many of the assets I got (especially images) had to be redesigned and recreated to provide further and better optimizations before they could be used.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="sr">Eyowo Project</h4>
                        <p>
                            The designers, led by Temidayo Oluwaniyi — a very talented designer with an impeccable attention to detail, would create the assets and send them over to me via the Slack channel.
                        </p><p>
                            The project was based on an agile approach which welcomed changes and iterations as and when they were required and necessary based on the then current progress. These discussions were always fruitful and had a direct impact on how the design and back-end synchronized together and how they affected the design of the interface—more specifically, that of the Web application dashboard. My role as a front-end developer was to bridge and connect the two tiers to help build a more user as well as dev- and design-friendly UI/X.
